## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The thing I had taken away most from this project was planning out design at multiple designs with a mobile first focus. Seeing how the different images would change each iteration was a little tought to think about initially but I am thankful they gave a lot of assets for this. Things like decerning grid and flex was also important too.

### Continued development

In future projects the thing I want to focus on is getting to this finished product faster and I think I can do that through practicing more.

### Useful resources

- I had asked some small simple formatting questions to raycast ai when I had wanted to make sure on some commands.
